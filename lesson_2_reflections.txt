1. What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created which will store all
the metadata for your repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains only what you want
to commit to the repository from your working
directory in your next commit. It is valueable
as it allows you to keep files in your working
directory but outside of your repository if 
those files are not ready to be comitted.
