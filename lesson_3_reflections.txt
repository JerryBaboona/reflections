When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Using a remote repository is useful if you are working from multiple computers, because 
then you can access your repo from any of them, or if you are collaborating with others
as they will be able to access the repo and make changes from their own machines.

Commands:
git add remote remonte_name url
Adds a remote link to your repository.
The url is the url of your repo on github.
Once this is done you can push your commits
up to your github repository.

git push remote branch
This command pushes the branch "branch" up
to the chosen remote. Note that when pushing
changes to your remote you do it in terms of
branches, rather than individual commits.

git pull remote branch
This command pulls down the chosen branch 
from remote on github.
